# KIRO JUMP (My first Game as a project)

A game done through my free time to entertain myself and to train myself on game development.

Game development is a hobby for me. to pass time and to escape from our horrible reality.

## Game Story

The game is starting with ~KIRO~ a white simple alien who needs to escape this so called ~LATA~ planet by jumping space jumps in the two directions and to avoid the obstacles in the way. The thing is that he doesn't know how much he needs to jump into space. Because ~GRAVITT~ Kiros' enemy is too powerful with his gravity force that pulls Kiro down and also ~OBSY~ the obstacles maker who tries to close Kiros' way into space.

GRAVITT: NO ESCAPE FROM MY PLANET !!!
KIRO: I need to get back home.
GRAVITT: BUT I NEED YOU TO STAY WITH ME.
GRAVITT: OBSYYYY !!!
OBSY: Yes Griv?
GRAVITT: HELP ME AND STOP HIM !!!
OBSY: Will do my friend :evil: 

Will you help ~KIRO~ to escape ~LATA~ Planet.

## Nothing more to say for NOW !!!
